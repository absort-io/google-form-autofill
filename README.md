# Warning.
Code is basically working, but NEEDS a lot of optimization to be declared as 'fully functional'.
Feel free to study it, that's the main purpose.

# Introduction
Auto-filling google form using selenium and python.

# Description
This is a beginner project; my first attempt to code using python. There might be unconsistency and inaccuracy lying here and there but this should give anyone the general idea.

Original goal of this project is to ease my personal online attendance. 
The attendance itself is using google form, with different links every single day. It's one of the reason I'm choosing to use the selenium way.
